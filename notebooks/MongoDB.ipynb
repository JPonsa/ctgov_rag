Not only is congestive heart failure the most common cardiovascular indication for hospitalization in patients 65 years or older, but frequent repetitive hospitalizations, occurring in 30-50 percent of patients within three to six months of initial discharge, create an imposing cost burden in caring for these patients. A pilot study conducted at the grantee institution has shown that elderly congestive heart failure patients at risk for early readmission can be identified at the time of initial hospitalization, that up to 50 percent of readmissions are potentially preventable, and that a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy consisting of patient education, medication analysis, discharge planning, and enhanced follow-up is feasible and may reduce readmissions by 30 to 50 percent.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nIn the feasibility study, patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention or standard care over a four year period. Patients were stratified into readmission risk categories of high or moderate based on the presence of four independent risk factors for readmission defined in a prior study at Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. The risk factors included: four or more prior hospitalizations within the preceding five-year interval, previous history of congestive heart failure, hypocholesterolemia, and right bundle-branch block on the admitting electrocardiogram. The study intervention consisted of individualized patient education using teaching materials specifically designed for the study; a careful review of medications with specific recommendations designed to eliminate unnecessary drugs, decrease the number of dosing intervals, improve compliance, and minimize side effects; early discharge planning; and enhanced post-discharge follow-up. The primary endpoints were rehospitalization within 90 days after initial hospital discharge and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. Principal secondary endpoints included analyses of the effect of the study intervention on compliance with prescribed medications, dietary sodium intake, incidence of adverse drug reactions, patient knowledge and understanding of congestive heart failure, patient-assessed quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care.\\\\n\\\\nIn the full-scale trial, 140 patients were assigned to the control group which received all standard treatments and services ordered by their physicians. A total of 142 patients were assigned to the treatment group which received intensive education about congestive heart failure and its treatment by an experienced cardiovascular research nurse, using a teaching booklet developed by study investigators for geriatric patients with heart failure. Treatment group patients also received individualized dietary assessment and instruction given by a registered dietitian; consultation with social-service personnel to facilitate discharge planning and care after discharge; an analysis of medications by a geriatric cardiologist who made specific recommendations to eliminate unnecessary medications and simplify the overall regimen; and intensive follow-up after discharge. The goals of follow-up were to reinforce the patient\\\\s education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis. The primary outcome measure was survival for 90 days without hospital readmission. Secondary endpoints included the number of readmissions for any cause, the number of readmissions for congestive heart failure, the cumulative number of days of hospitalization during follow-up, quality-of-life scores, and the overall cost of medical care.\\\\n\\\\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.}, conditionsModule: {conditions: [Cardiovascular Diseases, Heart Diseases, Heart Failure, Congestive, Heart Failure]}, designModule: {studyType: INTERVENTIONAL, phases: [PHASE2], designInfo: {allocation: RANDOMIZED, primaryPurpose: PREVENTION}}, armsInterventionsModule: {interventions: [{type: BEHAVIORAL, name: health education}]}, eligibilityModule: {eligibilityCriteria: Men and women, ages 70 or older, with documented congestive heart failure., healthyVolunteers: False, sex: ALL, minimumAge: 70 Years, maximumAge: 100 Years}, contactsLocationsModule: {}}, derivedSection: {conditionBrowseModule: {meshes: [{id: D000006333, term: Heart Failure}, {id: D000002318, term: Cardiovascular Diseases}, {id: D000006331, term: Heart Diseases}]}}, hasResults: False}', metadata={'database': 'ctGov', 'collection': 'preprocessed', 'filename': \": 'NCT00001\"}),\n",

Several trials suggested that beta-blockers may also reduce mortality. In the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, patients with a history of heart failure had less cardiac and sudden-death mortality than those who did not. Patients with a low ejection fraction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial who were treated with beta-blockade also had a reduction in mortality. The Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy trial randomized patients with dilated cardiomyopathies to treatment with metoprolol or placebo. There was a trend toward reduction in a morbidity and mortality endpoint in patients treated with metoprolol, but this was due entirely to a reduction in the need for cardiac transplantation. Thus, despite a reasonable theoretical basis and suggestive clinical studies, the concept that beta-blockers reduced mortality in congestive heart failure patients was unproved.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nRandomized, double-blind, multicenter.

The patient with class IV heart failure has a one year survival rate of only 40 to 50 percent. This is despite advances in medical therapy and the availability of ACE inhibitors. While cardiac transplantation is the most viable form of treatment for these patients, it is limited by complications of chronic immunosuppression, the development of graft coronary artery disease and the serious shortage of donor organs. As many as 16,500 patients per year may be suitable candidates for heart transplantation. The actual number of donor hearts procured over the past few years, however, has remained relatively constant at 2,000. Thus, there is a strong rationale for the therapeutic application of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as an alternative to cardiac transplantation.\\\\n\\\\nWith respect to LVAD efficacy, patients have been supported for periods as long as 344 days on the pneumatic system and 503 days with the electromechanical device. Experience with the TCI pneumatic system in 75 LVAD patients show improved one year survival after transplantation in the LVAD patients as opposed to patients who did not receive the LVAD despite the same selection criteria. Experience with the vented electric LVADs in bridge patients show a transplant and survival rate that is similar to the pneumatic device. LVADs have also been shown to have a favorable effect on circulatory hemodynamics and exercise capacity. Among 53 patients who survived the TCI LVAD procedure, 90 percent improved to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and 10 percent to functional class II.\\\\n\\\\nWith respect to safety, the principal adverse effects associated with the LVADs include bleeding, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, thromboembolism, infection, right heart failure, and mechanical failure. Thromboembolic complications are low in the TCI device despite the lack of systemic anticoagulation. The overall mechanical failure rate is small, less than 1 percent in 26 patient years of use. The vented electric and pneumatic device experience to date indicates that the devices are similar with respect to adverse event rates. Thus, in 1997 there was a strong rationale for a randomized controlled trial that compared the benefits and cost of vented electric LVADs to medical treatment. The need to perform a randomized controlled study was further emphasized by the lack of rigorous data on survival, quality of life, and cost effectiveness comparing LVAD support with medical therapy.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nUnblinded, randomized, multicenter. Patients were randomized to either the Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc. (TCI) vented electric (VE) LVAD or optimal medical therapy (OMM) and followed for at least two years.

If randomized to medical therapy, patients received optimal medical management including the use of digoxin, diuretics, and ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors in maximally tolerated doses. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, exercise capacity (six-minute walk test) and health-related quality of life, adverse effects, and the relative cost-effectiveness of LVADs versus medical management.

The study addresses the problem and tests two interventions that have promise of benefit. To date, many of the therapies that have been tested for congestive heart failure have either been ineffective or actually decreased survival. Conventional therapy is still relatively ineffective in that recent studies such as the Congestive Heart Failure - Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT) have demonstrated a mortality of 40 percent during two-and-half years of follow-up. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appears to be effective in patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest, but until recently, the devices required a thoracotomy and had to be reserved for patients with the highest risk for sudden death. The newer transvenous devices with pectoral patches can now be considered for broader applications. Although there have been mixed results with amiodarone in patients with congestive heart failure, there is a general consensus that it could be effective in the proper subset of patients with congestive heart failure. A comparison of the optimal device and drug is appropriate for such a high risk population.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nThree-armed, randomized, multicenter trial conducted at over 125 North American, Australian and New Zealand sites. Patients were enrolled over 2.5 years after being randomly assigned to amiodarone, matched placebo or an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Median follow-up was 45.5 months. All three arms used conventional therapy for heart failure and coronary artery disease (ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering and beta-blockers). The central hypothesis was that amiodarone or the ICD would improve survival compared to placebo. The primary outcome was the prevention of all-cause mortality.

A secondary objective was to determine costs and resource utilization of PAC-directed treatment strategy compared to non-invasive treatment strategy., detailedDescription: BACKGROUND:\\\\n\\\\nCongestive heart failure constitutes one of the major categories of morbidity, particularly in the elderly, and is responsible for the utilization of significant resources, including a large number of hospitalizations (estimated at 800,000 to 2.3 million per year) and related health care costs. In 1993, 4.7 million Americans carried the diagnosis of CHF, and about 400,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. It is estimated that there are 800,000 to 1.2 million CHF patients with NYHA class III-IV symptoms. The diagnosis and treatment of CHF and its episodes of decompensation can be facilitated by pulmonary artery catheter use, but its efficacy is highly dependent on the physician\\\\s experience in the treatment of such patients. Recently, concern has been raised about the benefits of PAC, also known as Swan-Ganz catheterization.\\\\n\\\\nIn response to concerns about the benefits and safety of PAC, the NHLBI and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) co-sponsored a workshop in August 1997 entitiled \"Pulmonary Artery Catheterization and Clinical Outcomes (PACCO)\". The purpose of the workshop was to provide an objective assessment of the state-of-the-science of PAC and its various uses. Experts in critical care, pulmonary medicine, cardiovascular medicine, surgery, pediatric cardiology, nursing, biostatistics, ethics, and medical economics identified several important clinical areas as priorities for clinical trials; persistent/refractory congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV) received top priority to test whether a PAC-directed treatment strategy achieves a better and less costly long-term outcome compared to a non-invasive treatment strategy. In addition to providing data on outcome, hospital utilization, and costs, the study would have additional benefits. For example, it would provide a clear benchmark for testing other technologies, now in developmental stages, that could supplant PAC in the future. Finally, the study would provide the basis for developing competency requirements for physicians, nurses, and others who insert and use pulmonary artery catheters, which was a strong recommendation of the PACCO Workshop.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nPatients were randomized into two treatment arms: A total of 218 patients were assigned into a treatment strategy without PAC hemodynamic monitoring (Usual Group) and 215 patients into a treatment strategy guided by PAC (Hemodynamic Group). The primary endpoint was the combined endpoint of rehospitalization and death.\\\\n\\\\nFor all patients randomized, therapy was tailored to the ultimate goal of discharge on an oral medical regimen to provide better relief of CHF symptoms, to reduce filling pressures and to maintain adequate perfusion. These goals were the same for both groups, but in the Usual Group therapy was adjusted according to clinical assessment alone, while in the PAC-directed group, actual measurement of hemodynamics was used to supplement clinical assessment. The oral medical regimen for discharge was designed by the attending heart failure physician based on the standard available medications of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), nitrates, hydralazine, furosemide and other diuretic agents. Intravenous diuretics were used when major diuresis was desired with subsequent change to oral diuretics at least 48 hours before discharge. Physicians could also use low dose infusions of dopamine or dobutamine to facilitate diuresis. Intravenous nitroprusside could be used in either group.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Usual Group, therapy was tailored to the following goals: a) absence of evidence of elevated intracardiac filling pressures; relief of orthopnea; relief of abdominal discomfort attributed to hepatosplenchnic congestion; resolution of peripheral edema, ascites, and rales; reduction of jugular venous distension to 5 cm or less above sternal angle; and b) adequate peripheral perfusion; warm extremities, if they could be achieved, and pulse pressure 25 percent or more , or, if less, the greatest which could be achieved. Either during or after hemodynamic monitoring, therapy could be adjusted to achieve the clinical goals above and further adjusted, if necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and renal function for all patients. Patients for whom therapy was adjusted without hemodynamic monitoring could crossover for hemodynamic monitoring at any time they reached certain criteria. The criteria for crossover included: need to add intravenous inotropic agents above 3 mcg/kg/minute to prevent symptomatic hypotension; repeated inability to discontinue low-dose inotropic agents; or renal insufficiency.\\\\n\\\\nIn the PAC-directed hemodynamic arm, therapy was adjusted to achieve specific hemodynamic goals in addition to the clinical goals in the Usual Group. These goals could include: pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 15 mm Hg or less; right atrial pressure 8mm Hg or less unless PCWP is 15 mm Hg or less; maintenance of systolic blood pressure of 80 or above, except for occasional transient decreases to lower levels after oral medications.\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of the goals by which therapy was adjusted in the hospital, the following conditions were met prior to discharge: 24 hours on oral medications alone without major medication change except for anticoagulation, and 48 hours after discontinuation of any intravenous inotropic medications; stable fluid balance; patient education; and home services and follow-up appointment.\\\\n\\\\nPost-discharge management was the same for both groups, according to standard practice. Patients were followed for adjustment of CHF medications in their heart failure clinics at one to two weeks, four weeks, three months, and six months and more often if clinically indicated. There was a minimum of six months of follow-up.\\\\n\\\\nData collection included: blood pressure and weight at each visit; electrocardiogram at pre-randomization visit and at each hospitalization; serum electrolytes; echocardiogram at randomization, at hospitalization discharge, and at six month follow-up; exercise stress tests during index hospitalization and six month follow-up; natriuretic hormone profile at randomization, discharge, and six month follow-up; medical history, endpoints, side effects, hospitalizations and quality of life; and compliance with protocol.\\\\n\\\\nThe study consisted of a Clinical Coordinating Center which included a network of 26 clinical units, and an echocardiographic core laboratory. The Protocol developed extended for six months, patient recruitment extended for 48 months, follow-up for six months, and data analysis for six months.\\\\n\\\\nThe NHLBI has awarded R01HL67691 in April 2001 as an ancillary study.

One of the four chambers, the left ventricle, is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into the circulation. Diseases of the heart like congestive heart failure (CHF), can cause the left ventricle to function improperly.\\\\n\\\\nMedications called beta-blockers appear to reverse the abnormalities in the left ventricle and frequently improve the function of the left ventricle in patients with different kinds of heart disease. How beta-blockers improve left ventricle function is unknown.\\\\n\\\\nOne possible reason for improved function of the left ventricle with beta-blockers is improved blood flow to the heart muscle. When a region of the heart is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As heart activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive sugar (glucose) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to observe what areas of the heart are receiving more blood flow.\\\\n\\\\nIn this study researchers plan to measure glucose use in heart muscle and blood flow to the heart muscle in patients with CHF taking beta-blockers., detailedDescription: Deterioration in left ventricular function, which is characteristic in patients with congestive heart failure, appears to be a multifactorial process. Beta-blockers appear to reverse the deterioration and frequently improve left ventricular function in patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The mechanism by which beta-blockers improve ejection fraction is not known. Although it is well established that regional flow, function and metabolism may improve after coronary revascularization whether beta-blocker therapy will have similar salutary results in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. The aim of this study is to: 1) quantitate regional glucose uptake and regional blood flow before and after chronic beta-blocker administration to patients with congestive heart failure using positron emission tomography, 2) determine if alteration in either regional glucose or lipid uptake or regional blood flow correlate with improvement in wall motion and global left ventricular function, and 3) determine if ischemic and nonischemic myocardium differ in blood flow or metabolism.}, conditionsModule: {conditions: [Heart Failure, Congestive], keywords: [Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hibernating Myocardium, Ischemic Cardiomyopathy, Metoprolol, Stress Thallium Scintigraphy, Congestive Cardiomyopathy, Congestive Heart Failure, Heart Failure]}, designModule: {studyType: INTERVENTIONAL, phases: [PHASE2], designInfo: {primaryPurpose: TREATMENT}, enrollmentInfo: {count: 130}}, armsInterventionsModule: {interventions: [{type: DEVICE, name: PET scan}]}, eligibilityModule: {eligibilityCriteria: Left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography of less than or equal to 40%.\\\\n\\\\nNew York Heart Association class II, III or IV symptoms on standard heart failure medications which my include digoxin, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least one month prior to enrollment.\\\\n\\\\nIschemic cardiomyopathy if enzymes document an MI or 70% or greater stenosis in one major vessel.\\\\n\\\\nDilated cardiomyopathy-if no coronary disease.\\\\n\\\\nNo pregnant or lactating women.\\\\n\\\\nNo women of child-bearing age not on proven birth control.\\\\n\\\\nNo severe hepatic or renal disease.\\\\n\\\\nNo diabetes mellitus or fasting glucose greater than or equal to 120 mg/dl.\\\\n\\\\nNo primary valvular heart disease.\\\\n\\\\nNo PTCA or CABG within 3 months of enrollment.\\\\n\\\\nNo history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within past 2 months.\\\\n\\\\nNo resting heart rate less than 60 bpm.\\\\n\\\\nNo A-V block greater than 1 degree block without pacemaker.\\\\n\\\\nNo severe ETOH abuse within 6 months of enrollment.\\\\n\\\\nNo severe bronchospasm., healthyVolunteers: False, sex: ALL}, contactsLocationsModule: {locations: [{facility: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), city: Bethesda, state: Maryland, zip: 20892, country: United States, geoPoint: {lat: 38.98067, lon: -77.10026}}]}}, derivedSection: {conditionBrowseModule: {meshes: [{id: D000006333, term: Heart Failure}, {id: D000009202, term: Cardiomyopathies}]}}, hasResults: False}', metadata={'database': 'ctGov', 'collection': 'preprocessed', 'filename': 'NCT00001313'}),\n",
