Not only is congestive heart failure the most common cardiovascular indication for hospitalization in patients 65 years or older, but frequent repetitive hospitalizations, occurring in 30-50 percent of patients within three to six months of initial discharge, create an imposing cost burden in caring for these patients. A pilot study conducted at the grantee institution has shown that elderly congestive heart failure patients at risk for early readmission can be identified at the time of initial hospitalization, that up to 50 percent of readmissions are potentially preventable, and that a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy consisting of patient education, medication analysis, discharge planning, and enhanced follow-up is feasible and may reduce readmissions by 30 to 50 percent.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nIn the feasibility study, patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention or standard care over a four year period. Patients were stratified into readmission risk categories of high or moderate based on the presence of four independent risk factors for readmission defined in a prior study at Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. The risk factors included: four or more prior hospitalizations within the preceding five-year interval, previous history of congestive heart failure, hypocholesterolemia, and right bundle-branch block on the admitting electrocardiogram. The study intervention consisted of individualized patient education using teaching materials specifically designed for the study; a careful review of medications with specific recommendations designed to eliminate unnecessary drugs, decrease the number of dosing intervals, improve compliance, and minimize side effects; early discharge planning; and enhanced post-discharge follow-up. The primary endpoints were rehospitalization within 90 days after initial hospital discharge and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. Principal secondary endpoints included analyses of the effect of the study intervention on compliance with prescribed medications, dietary sodium intake, incidence of adverse drug reactions, patient knowledge and understanding of congestive heart failure, patient-assessed quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care.\\\\n\\\\nIn the full-scale trial, 140 patients were assigned to the control group which received all standard treatments and services ordered by their physicians. A total of 142 patients were assigned to the treatment group which received intensive education about congestive heart failure and its treatment by an experienced cardiovascular research nurse, using a teaching booklet developed by study investigators for geriatric patients with heart failure. Treatment group patients also received individualized dietary assessment and instruction given by a registered dietitian; consultation with social-service personnel to facilitate discharge planning and care after discharge; an analysis of medications by a geriatric cardiologist who made specific recommendations to eliminate unnecessary medications and simplify the overall regimen; and intensive follow-up after discharge. The goals of follow-up were to reinforce the patient\\'s education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis. The primary outcome measure was survival for 90 days without hospital readmission. Secondary endpoints included the number of readmissions for any cause, the number of readmissions for congestive heart failure, the cumulative number of days of hospitalization during follow-up, quality-of-life scores, and the overall cost of medical care.\\\\n\\\\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \\\\\"End Date\\\\\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.\"}}}}', metadata={'filename': 'NCT00000475'}),\n",

Several trials suggested that beta-blockers may also reduce mortality. In the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, patients with a history of heart failure had less cardiac and sudden-death mortality than those who did not. Patients with a low ejection fraction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial who were treated with beta-blockade also had a reduction in mortality. The Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy trial randomized patients with dilated cardiomyopathies to treatment with metoprolol or placebo. There was a trend toward reduction in a morbidity and mortality endpoint in patients treated with metoprolol, but this was due entirely to a reduction in the need for cardiac transplantation.

The patient with class IV heart failure has a one year survival rate of only 40 to 50 percent. This is despite advances in medical therapy and the availability of ACE inhibitors. While cardiac transplantation is the most viable form of treatment for these patients, it is limited by complications of chronic immunosuppression, the development of graft coronary artery disease and the serious shortage of donor organs. As many as 16,500 patients per year may be suitable candidates for heart transplantation. The actual number of donor hearts procured over the past few years, however, has remained relatively constant at 2,000. Thus, there is a strong rationale for the therapeutic application of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as an alternative to cardiac transplantation.\\\\n\\\\nWith respect to LVAD efficacy, patients have been supported for periods as long as 344 days on the pneumatic system and 503 days with the electromechanical device. Experience with the TCI pneumatic system in 75 LVAD patients show improved one year survival after transplantation in the LVAD patients as opposed to patients who did not receive the LVAD despite the same selection criteria. Experience with the vented electric LVADs in bridge patients show a transplant and survival rate that is similar to the pneumatic device. LVADs have also been shown to have a favorable effect on circulatory hemodynamics and exercise capacity. Among 53 patients who survived the TCI LVAD procedure, 90 percent improved to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and 10 percent to functional class II.\\\\n\\\\nWith respect to safety, the principal adverse effects associated with the LVADs include bleeding, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, thromboembolism, infection, right heart failure, and mechanical failure. Thromboembolic complications are low in the TCI device despite the lack of systemic anticoagulation. The overall mechanical failure rate is small, less than 1 percent in 26 patient years of use. The vented electric and pneumatic device experience to date indicates that the devices are similar with respect to adverse event rates. Thus, in 1997 there was a strong rationale for a randomized controlled trial that compared the benefits and cost of vented electric LVADs to medical treatment. The need to perform a randomized controlled study was further emphasized by the lack of rigorous data on survival, quality of life, and cost effectiveness comparing LVAD support with medical therapy.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nUnblinded, randomized, multicenter. Patients were randomized to either the Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc. (TCI) vented electric (VE) LVAD or optimal medical therapy (OMM) and followed for at least two years. If randomized to LVAD therapy, patients received a LVAD implantation within 12 hours of randomization. If randomized to medical therapy, patients received optimal medical management including the use of digoxin, diuretics, and ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors in maximally tolerated doses. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, exercise capacity (six-minute walk test) and health-related quality of life, adverse effects, and the relative cost-effectiveness of LVADs versus medical management.

The study addresses the problem and tests two interventions that have promise of benefit. To date, many of the therapies that have been tested for congestive heart failure have either been ineffective or actually decreased survival. Conventional therapy is still relatively ineffective in that recent studies such as the Congestive Heart Failure - Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT) have demonstrated a mortality of 40 percent during two-and-half years of follow-up. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appears to be effective in patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest, but until recently, the devices required a thoracotomy and had to be reserved for patients with the highest risk for sudden death. The newer transvenous devices with pectoral patches can now be considered for broader applications. Although there have been mixed results with amiodarone in patients with congestive heart failure, there is a general consensus that it could be effective in the proper subset of patients with congestive heart failure. A comparison of the optimal device and drug is appropriate for such a high risk population.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nThree-armed, randomized, multicenter trial conducted at over 125 North American, Australian and New Zealand sites. Patients were enrolled over 2.5 years after being randomly assigned to amiodarone, matched placebo or an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Median follow-up was 45.5 months. All three arms used conventional therapy for heart failure and coronary artery disease (ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering and beta-blockers). The central hypothesis was that amiodarone or the ICD would improve survival compared to placebo. The primary outcome was the prevention of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome measures included cardiac mortality and arrhythmic mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions.\\\\n\\\\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \\\\\"End Date\\\\\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.\"}}}}', metadata={'filename': 'NCT00000609'}),\n",

Morbidity and mortality surveillance of the original cohort is continuing.\", \"detailedDescription\": \"BACKGROUND:\\\\n\\\\nThe Honolulu Heart Program was initiated to verify reports that men of Japanese ancestry living in the United States had a much higher risk of coronary heart disease and a lower risk of stroke than Japanese men in Japan. The Honolulu Heart Program was actually a component of the larger NI-HON-SAN Study. The NI-HON-SAN Study (from the acronyms Nippon, Honolulu, and San Francisco) was initiated in 1965. The populations under investigation included members of the Honolulu Heart Program as well as men of Japanese ancestry born between 1900 and 1919 and residing in Japan and San Francisco.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Honolulu Heart Program, 11,148 men were identified of whom 8,006 participated in baseline examinations between 1965 and 1968. The 1965 - 1968 examination included a detailed medical and social history with specific inquiries about smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity. A physical examination focussed on the cardiovascular system; laboratory tests included hematocrit, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, glucose determination, and urinalysis. A twelve lead electrocardiogram and lung function testing revealed that 301 men had evidence of coronary heart disease and 111 had a stroke. The prevalence of coronary heart disease was slightly higher than in the comparable population in Japan, but the incidence rate during the first two-year period of follow-up was twice as high in Honolulu as in Japan. Stroke prevalence was much higher in Japan than in the Honolulu cohort, with a threefold difference. The Honolulu Japanese men were more obese, ate a more Westernized diet with a higher amount of animal protein, saturated fat, and sucrose and a smaller amount of complex carbohydrates. They had higher levels of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, and glucose than Japanese men in Japan. Cigarette smoking was more common in the Japanese cohort, while the proportion of heavy smokers was greater in the Honolulu cohort. Alcohol consumption in the Japanese cohort was twice that of the Honolulu cohort. There were no differences in mean blood pressure or prevalence of hypertension. Repeat examinations were performed near the second and sixth anniversaries of the initial examinations. The six year follow-up data identified 294 new cases of coronary heart disease and 133 new cases of stroke. Between 1970 and 1972 some 2,800 of the cohort were examined and had lipoprotein determinations performed as part of the NHLBI Lipoprotein Phenotyping Project. Survivors of the lipoprotein cohort were reexamined between 1975 and 1978 near the tenth anniversary of their initial examination and again between 1980 and 1982.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1985, the program was enlarged to make a comparative analysis of the 12-year incidence of coronary heart disease in the Japanese and Hawaii study cohort of the original NI-HON-SAN Study, to sample 400 offspring of the study cohort ages 45 to 60 years and to complete nutrient indicators for association with blood pressure in a manner consistent with the United States-Japan study of nutrition and blood pressure. Resulting data were compared with a comparable selected group of Japanese men and with the parents of the offspring to examine familial associations. Pulmonary function data were recorded and analyzed for association with other risk factors, respiratory disease, and other major chronic diseases.\\\\n\\\\nBeginning in March 1993 and continuing through December 1994, the National Institute on Aging, with its own funds, investigated aging and dementia among Honolulu Heart Program participants.\\\\n\\\\nBeginning in March 1997, the study was supported by U01HL56274.\\\\n\\\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\\\n\\\\nIn this prospective cohort study, the hospital discharge rosters of all general hospitals on the Island of Oahu were reviewed twice yearly as part of the morbidity and mortality surveillance. The appropriate chart materials were abstracted for review by study physicians for evidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Beginning in 1986, both old and new hospital discharge records were reviewed for the additional endpoints of congestive heart failure, aortic aneurysm, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia, organic brain syndrome, and Parkinson\\'s disease. Deaths were monitored by following obituary columns as well as reviewing death certificates from the State Health Department. There was daily contact with hospitals to find out about impending autopsies in which study personnel could participate. However, only 20-25 percent of the deaths had protocol autopsies.\\\\n\\\\nThe fifth and final complete examination of the surviving cohort concluded in Spring, 1996 under a contract with the National Institute on Aging. While the emphasis of this exam was the investigation of dementia, NHLBI funded the recording of blood pressures and ECGs as well as the continued surveillance for morbidity and mortality. A cooperative agreement extends the surveillance for an additional five years. As part of the close-out phase of the study, frozen blood samples collected since the study\\'s inception have been sent to a repository in Rockville, MD. A review board for screening prospective users of this resource holds quarterly meetings.\\\\n\\\\nAs the study group includes both migrants from Japan and Hawaii-born men, there is a spectrum of cultural lifestyles and varying grades of acculturation which are being examined as risk factors for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. The existing baseline and follow-up examination data and the surveillance information on the incidence of most major diseases provide opportunities for a great variety of research projects concerning the predictors of cardiovascular disease, as well as studies of the broader concepts of health and disease in the aging population. The low out-migration rate and the well-defined sources of medical care have provided an ideal setting for maintaining disease morbidity and mortality surveillance; nearly 100 per cent of hospital discharge episodes have been recorded. As the study participants range in age from 75-95 in 1996, the rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases are increasing rapidly and thus are providing a large number of disease endpoints for study. Other Institutes are also currently supporting activities which utilize the original cohort.\\\\n\\\\nStored sera provide an opportunity to test new ideas and etiologic hypotheses using both prospective and case-control study designs. Protocol autopsy information can now be utilized to examine relationships among risk factors, clinical manifestations of CHD, and stroke and pathological evidence of atherosclerosis.\\\\n\\\\nBeginning in 1997, a cooperative agreement extends the surveillance for an additional five years through February, 2002. As part of the close-out of the study, frozen blood samples collected since the study\\'s inception have been sent to a repository in Rockville, Maryland.\"}}}}', metadata={'filename': 'NCT00005123'}),\n",

How beta-blockers improve left ventricle function is unknown.\\\\n\\\\nOne possible reason for improved function of the left ventricle with beta-blockers is improved blood flow to the heart muscle. When a region of the heart is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As heart activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive sugar (glucose) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to observe what areas of the heart are receiving more blood flow.\\\\n\\\\nIn this study researchers plan to measure glucose use in heart muscle and blood flow to the heart muscle in patients with CHF taking beta-blockers.\", \"detailedDescription\": \"Deterioration in left ventricular function, which is characteristic in patients with congestive heart failure, appears to be a multifactorial process.

Although it is well established that regional flow, function and metabolism may improve after coronary revascularization whether beta-blocker therapy will have similar salutary results in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. The aim of this study is to: 1) quantitate regional glucose uptake and regional blood flow before and after chronic beta-blocker administration to patients with congestive heart failure using positron emission tomography, 2) determine if alteration in either regional glucose or lipid uptake or regional blood flow correlate with improvement in wall motion and global left ventricular function, and 3) determine if ischemic and nonischemic myocardium differ in blood flow or metabolism.\"}}}}', metadata={'filename': 'NCT00001402'}),\n",
