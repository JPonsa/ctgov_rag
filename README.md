# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for ClinicalTrials.gov

## Summary
Clinical Trials (CTs) constitute a cornerstone of medical research, providing critical evidence for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new treatments and interventions. With the average cost of a single phase in CTs ranging from 1.4 million to 52.9 million US dollars, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches to maximize the utility of trial data. However, despite their importance, the complexity and volume of CT data present significant challenges for efficient analysis and interpretation.

This project combines a Knowledge Graph (KG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to overcome the challenges in analyzing and interpreting Clinical Trials (CTs) data.

The proposed querying framework aims to enable researchers to streamline analysis tasks such as identifying trends in CTs related to specific diseases. This integration maximizes the utility of CT data, facilitating more efficient analysis, interpretation, and utilization, ultimately advancing medical research progress.

## Aims:
1.	Create a tool that enables medical researchers to analyse large and complex datasets of clinical trial protocols using natural language. 
2.	Evaluate the feasibility of utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for analysing and querying clinical trial protocols and results from clinicalTrials.gov
3.	Assess the effectiveness of Knowledge Graph â€“ Retrieve Augmented Generation (KG-RAG)  on clinical trial studies to enhance LLMs querying and analysing capabilities.

## Features:
- text-2-SQL system for AACT.
- ctGov Knowledge Graph with BioBert Embedding as Node properties
- ReAct approached using specialised tools:
  - Semantic Search for Conditions and Interventions and retrieve the associated CTs, Adverse Events or other information.
  - Ask questions to Meditron7b (a medical LLM)
  - Analytical tool:
    - Generate and run SQL queries against AACT.
    - Generate and run Cypher queries against KG.  
- Retrieval Augmented Generation using llama3 or mixtral8x7b

## Evaluation / Use Cases:
- Respond to specific questions regarding a single clinical trial protocol or condition or intervention.
- Patient - CT matching. Given a patient note identify CT studies where the patient would be eligible for enrollment.
